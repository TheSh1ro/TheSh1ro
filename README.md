**Programmer, I like to problem-solving and learn new techs whenever possible, although I have a special fondness for javascript**  
Started coding at 12 with C++, later tried Python, JS/TS, React, Vue, Electron, and Django. 
Familiarized with some databases and cloud services.

Currently working on:
- **Selenium + Pandas** automation and other tech for scalable data analysis.
- **Discord bot** and **Vue** application with AI integration for server management with personalities.
- **AI optimization projects** and experimenting with social media bots.
- **Private projects** such as business solutions

One of my main goals right now is connecting with other developers and build projects together.
